# Legacy-JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
A page's styling and content are managed by HTML and CSS, but JavaScript adds interactivity. Learn the foundations of JavaScript, including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions, with the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

Once you understand the foundations, you may put your newfound knowledge to use by developing algorithms that can handle strings, and factorial numbers, and even determine the International Space Station's orbit.

Along the process, you'll learn two crucial programming paradigms: functional programming (FP) and object-oriented programming (OOP).
